Testing
-------

Testing works in two phases -- the encryption tests, and the decryption tests. The encryption test files consist of:

- encryption.c (driver code to run under simulation)
- aes_enc_tests.mspd (script for loading all the encryption subscripts)
- *-enc.mspd (test scripts derived from the NIST KAT verification suite)

The decryption test files consist of:

- decryption.c (driver code to run under simulation)
- aes_dec_tests.mspd (script for loading all the decryption subscripts)
- *-dec.mspd (test scripts derived from the NIST KAT verification suite)

For each phase, an appropriate stub program is compiled, and then mspdebug (in simulator mode) is used to load that stub. A series of mspdebug scripts are used to load the test vectors (key, input, expected output), run the stub, and then verify that the expected output matches the actual output. The complete output from mspdebug is stored in output-enc.txt and output-dec.txt. Failed tests will result in the text "mismatch" in these output files. Additionally, MCLK timings can be found in these files, in pairs -- the first reading is the time it took to expand the key, and the second reading is the time it took to perform the encryption or decryption operation.
