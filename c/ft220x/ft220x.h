/*! \file
 * Constants and API for interacting with the FT220X.
 *
 * The FT220X_CMD_* macros are a bit weird. While each command is documented as
 * having a straightforward ID (0, 1, 2, etc.), the reality is that the values
 * being sent out bear little resemblance to these straightforward IDs.
 *
 * Specifically, they're changed to [3]00[2]0[1][0]b (yes, that's _seven_ bits),
 * and then shuffled out MSB first. The macros reflect this mangling directly;
 * for example, the flush command is 0x04 -> 0000100b -> 0001000b -> 0001000b ->
 * 0x08.
 *
 * The FT220X_CMD_* macros, in their high-order byte, contain information
 * required to turn the bus once the command has been issued. These values are
 * replicated by the FT220X_M_* macros.
 *
 * In order to compile the corresponding implementation of this API, your build
 * will need to provide the following macro definiotns:
 *
 * - FT220X_WIDTH set to 1, 2 or 4; how many I/O lines are in use for the FT220X.
 * - FT220X_A_MISO_0, a constant address that the MISO line data can be read from.
 * - FT220X_B_MISO_0, the AND mask for FT220X_A_MISO_0 that enables reading the MISO pin.
 * - FT220X_A_MOSI_0, a constant address that the MOSI line data can be written to.
 * - FT220X_B_MOSI_0, the OR mask for FT220X_A_MOSI_0 that enables the MOSI pin.
 *
 * The above numbered macros have variants from 0-3. If FT220X_WIDTH is set to 1,
 * only the 0-series macros need to be defined; 2 requires 0-1; 4 requires 0-3.
 * Failure to have a correct set of macros defined will lead to a compile-time
 * error.
