 * API for low-level data transfer using Serial Peripheral Interface.
 *
 * In order to compile the corresponding implementation of this API, your build
 * will need to provide the following macro definiotns:
 *
 * - SPI_A_CLOCK, a reference to the clocking pin
 * - SPI_B_CLOCK, the OR mask for SPI_A_CLOCK that enables the clocking pin.
 * - SPI_A_MISO, a reference to the Master In/Slave Out pin.
 * - SPI_B_MISO, the AND mask for SPI_A_MISO that enables reading the MISO pin.
 * - SPI_A_MOSI, a reference to the Master Out/Slave In pin.
 * - SPI_B_MOSI, the OR mask for SPI_A_MOSI that enables the MOSI pin.
 * - SPI_A_T, the bare data type that the above references refer to.
 *
 * Note that this API supports only one SPI bus.
